# Polygon Triangulation

An implementation of polygon triangulation which first partitions the polygon into monotone parts and triangulates the monotone polygons. A DCEL is used to store the polygon and its monotone partitioning and the triangulation. Made as a part of the computation geometry course at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.
